## Inheritance
* This is one of the four pillars of OOP - great research topic
- A way we can get functionality (methods) from one class into another class
- some functionality that many classes share, can be combined into one parent class that gives that functionality to its children. Share functionality among the children of a parent.

- Type Of relation
  * Megan type of McMahon/Duran
  * Dog type of Mammal
  * Mammal type of Animal

- Child class is a type of Parent Class (superclass)

Dog < Mammal (children)
 - speak ('bork')

Cat < Mammal (children)
- speak ('meow')

Mammal < Animal (parent of Dog/Cat / superclass of Dog/Cat)
  - sit
  - eat

Animal (parent/superclass of Mammal)
 - name
 - age

- Superclass/parent can hold both attributes AND behavior
- any class can inherit from only ONE superclass(parent)
